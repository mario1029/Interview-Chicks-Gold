To operate the project correctly, Node.JS (v16.18.1) must be installed. When cloning the repository you must run the command 
```
npm i
```
This will install the dependencies. Then to start the API you must run the command
```
npm run dev
```
In principle if it works correctly you should see a message like this 
Server on port: 3000
Then you should access in your browser to: http://localhost:3000/water/home
